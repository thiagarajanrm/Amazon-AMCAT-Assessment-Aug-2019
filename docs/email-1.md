Hi Yourname,

Congratulations on moving forward in the first step of our interview process. I would like to invite you to complete the online technical assessment. You will be receiving another email shortly with the code assessment link. Please complete the assessment no later than one week from now. Once completed, I will follow up within 48 hours with next steps. Before you begin the assessment, please read the details below. I have attached a preparation document with tips and helpful links to aid in your successful completion of the exercise.

Upon a positive online code interview, and 30 minute phone interview with me (discussing your professional background and experience) we will move forward with scheduling you for the Onsite interviews. This will consist of a 4 hour interview at one of our offices in NYC, NY.
