Hi Firstname Lastname,
 
Thank you for your interest in Amazon’s SDE opportunities! We would like to invite you to complete our online assessment, the first step of our interview process. To be considered for interviews, please complete the assessment no later than a week from now. Your time investment in both of these exercises should take no more than 2 hours.

To begin the assessment, please read the instructions and follow the link below.
 
Online Assessment Overview
The assessment consists of these components:

a coding challenge with two scenarios (up to 90 min)
a "describe your approach" section to discuss your coding solutions (up to 15 min)
a work style survey (up to 15 min)
a feedback survey (5 min)

If you prefer to demo the coding assessment platform prior to beginning your actual assessment, you may do so using the following link: Coding Assessment Demo [https://www.somedemolink]

Instructions

Do not click the Assessment Link until you are ready to take the assessment in full. Set aside 2 hours in a quiet location where you will not be interrupted.

Ensure you have a reliable internet connection.
Please use one of the latest versions of Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari.
Languages available: Java, C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Swift.  Compiler versions can be found in the Aspiring Minds FAQs here[https://assess.myamcat.com/FAQ.php].
The time remaining for the coding challenge will be clearly displayed on the screen - manage your time wisely.
You will not be able to stop the timer once you have started the coding portion, so we recommend you complete the entire assessment in one sitting.
Next Steps

After completing the coding challenge and work style survey, you will receive a survey to provide us feedback. Once complete, a confirmation page will appear verifying you have completed the assessment and thanking you for your participation.

FAQs

What should I know about the coding challenge?

​During the code portion, you may use resources that are available to all candidates (e.g., the JDK or STL). Please use the in-browser editor for your coding as we will review your submittal. Please comment as much as possible.

Please note: You are expected to attempt both code questions, so manage your time wisely. If you get stuck, you can move on to the next problem, and revisit the previous question as needed.

When you submit your coding challenge, there will be a slight delay for a few minutes to process your code. This is expected. You will receive an email confirming that the submittal is complete and you can continue with the remainder of the assessment.

Can I take a break during the assessment?

Yes. If you need to take a break, the best time would be between the Coding Challenge and Work Style Survey.  If you choose to take a short break, log out after completing the Coding Challenge, and when you’re ready to resume, click the link below again and you will return to where you left off last. If you log out during the Coding Challenge, you must resume within an hour or your session will expire.

Troubleshooting

For any technical issues, please examine closely where you left off, log out, and log back in using the link above. Do not repeatedly refresh the screen. If you continue to experience technical issues, go to our Troubleshooting site[http://assess.myamcat.com/troubleshooting.php] for FAQs or use the live chat feature for assistance. If technical issues cannot be resolved, please contact your recruiter who is cc'd on this e-mail immediately.
 
We recognize this is a large time investment and we appreciate your interest in Amazon. If you have need to reach out regarding a question not addressed in this e-mail or you are no longer interested in participating, please contact your recruiter who is cc’d on the e-mail.
 
Thank you and best of luck!
