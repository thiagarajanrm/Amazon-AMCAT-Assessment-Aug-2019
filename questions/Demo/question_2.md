**Problem**  

<font color="#6bb1f6">The current selected programming language is <strong>Java</strong>. We emphasize the submission of a fully</br>
working code over partially correct but efficient code. Once <strong>submitted</strong>, you cannot review this</br>
program again. The version of <strong>JDK</strong> being used is <strong>1.8</strong></font>

The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called the highest common factor of N numbers is the  
largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.

Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.

**Input** 

The input to the function/method consists of two arguments - 
*num*, an integer representing the number of positive integers (N); 
*arr*, a list of positive integers. 

**Output**  

Return an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers.

**Example** 
Input:  
num = 5  
arr = [2,4,6,8,10]  
Output:  
2  
Explanation:  
The largest positive integer that divides all the postive integers 2,4,6,8, 10 without a remainder is 2.  
So, the output is 2.

**Testcases**

Testcase 1:
Input:
5
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Expected Return Value:
1

Testcase 2:
Input:
5
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Expected Return Value:
2
