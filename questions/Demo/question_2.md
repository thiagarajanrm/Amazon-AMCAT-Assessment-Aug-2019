**Problem**  

The current selected programming language is Java. We emphasize the submission of a fully working code over partially correct but efficient code. Once submitted, you cannot review this program again. The version of JDK being used is 1.8

The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called the highest common factor of N numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.

Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.

**Input** 

The input to the function/method consists of two arguments - 
*num*, an integer representing the number of positive integers (N); 
*arr*, a list of positive integers. 

**Output**  

Return an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers.

**Example** 
Input:
num=5
arr=[2,4,6,8,10]
Output:
2
Explanation:
The largest positive integer that divides all the postive integers 2,4,6,8, 10 without a remainder is 2. So, the output is 2.
